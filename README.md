# NLP Learning

## Overview
Welcome to the world of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Learning! This repository is designed to guide you through the fundamentals and advanced concepts of NLP, enabling you to understand, implement, and innovate within this exciting field.

## What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. It involves tasks such as text parsing, sentiment analysis, language translation, and speech recognition.

## Getting Started
To begin your journey into NLP, it's helpful to have a solid foundation in programming and a basic understanding of machine learning concepts. Familiarity with Python is highly recommended, as many NLP libraries and tools are built using Python.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming language.
- Understanding of fundamental machine learning concepts.
- Familiarity with command-line interface (CLI) tools.

## NLP Libraries and Tools
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data.
- spaCy: An industrial-strength natural language processing library.
- Gensim: Library for topic modeling, document indexing, and similarity retrieval.
- Transformers: Open-source library for natural language understanding using state-of-the-art transformer models.
- TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks that provide tools for building and training neural networks for NLP tasks.
